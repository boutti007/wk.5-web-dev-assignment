Project Overview
This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation. The project is organized into three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. Together, they create a basic interactive webpage.

Files Included
index.html – The main HTML structure of the page. It contains a heading, a list container, and a button.
style.css – A simple stylesheet to style the webpage.
script.js – The JavaScript logic file where variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and DOM interactions are implemented.

Features
Variables and conditionals are used to store and check data.
Two custom functions: greet() and addListItem().
Two types of loops: for loop and while loop.
DOM interactions including:

* Creating and appending new elements
* Modifying element styles
* Adding event listeners
* Changing the background color

Learning Outcomes
Understand how to declare and use variables in JavaScript.
Apply conditionals for logical decision-making.
Create and call functions to organize reusable code.
Use loops to reduce repetition and iterate over data.
Manipulate the DOM to update, style, and interact with webpage elements.

How to Run
Open index.html in a browser.
Click the button on the page to see the greet() function run.
Watch the background color and title style update through JavaScript.
Check the dynamically added list items that demonstrate loops.

Conclusion
This project provides a foundation in JavaScript fundamentals and DOM interaction, preparing you for more advanced web development topics.
